eeGeo 3D Maps iOS API Source
============================

Source code for the Objective-C iOS bindings for the eeGeo SDK, a C++11 OpenGL-based library for beautiful and customisable 3D maps.

* The API is distributed via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/eegeo).
* This repo contains the API implementation, and the PodSpec templates.
* To add a feature to the API, clone this repo and link against the latest [eeGeo SDK](http://s3.amazonaws.com/eegeo-static/sdk.package.ios.cpp11.tar.gz). Expose additional functionality as required. 
* Ideally, demonstrate the use of new functionality in the [iOS-api-example](https://github.com/eegeo/ios-api-example).
* Pull requests accepted.
